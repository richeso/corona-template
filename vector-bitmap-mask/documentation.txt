    -- let's make a "mask" group for our vector...
                local dynamicMask = display.newGroup();

    -- paint a screen sized background white and put it in the group.
                local thisRect = display.newRect (0,0,screenWidth, screenHeight)
                dynamicMask:insert(thisRect);

    -- create the vector rectangle that i want for my mask and put it in the group
                local thisRect = display.newRect (0,0,screenWidth-40, screenHeight-100)
                dynamicMask:insert(thisRect);

    -- paint the mask black - i want this area to SHOW THROUGH the mask.
                thisRect:setFillColor(0,0,0);

    -- position it.  i want a scroll view in the center of the screen -- so i need
    -- to position this rectangle in the middle of the screen, leaving some extra
    -- room up top for a title that doesn't scroll.
                thisRect.x =centerX;
                thisRect.y = centerY +20

    -- you could add addition vector objects here to create a complex mask.

    -- now the magic:
                display.save (dynamicMask, "tmp.jpg",  system.TemporaryDirectory)

    -- we don't need no stickin' badges -- get rid of the group.
                dynamicMask:removeSelf();

    -- but we do need our dynamically created, vector mask! ;-)
                local mask = graphics.newMask( "tmp.jpg", system.TemporaryDirectory )

    -- ta da!
                objectToMask:setMask(mask)
